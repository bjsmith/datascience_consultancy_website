title: COVID-19 SAFE BORDER PROJECT
type: feature
---

Covid-19 is a unique challenge in living memory. Responding to the pandemic has been a challenge for policy-makers around the world.

We build an interactive, dynamic visualization of the risk of opening New Zealand's borders up to low, medium, high, and Covid-free countries. Users can select countries to relax border controls and simulate any resulting increase in cases. The app automatically selects low-prevalence countries to demonstrate the low risk of travellers from those countries, while also displaying the danger in relaxing the border to high-prevalence countries.
